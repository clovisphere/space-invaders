# Space Invaders 🚀

> A retro arcade clone implemented in zig 🤭

This project is a zig implementation of the classic Space Invaders game. It is a port of the [C++ tutorial by Programming With Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGo3Oxdpr5o), created as a hands-on exercise to learn Zig's syntax, memory management, and build system.

## 📋 TODO
- [ ] **High Score System**: Implement persistent high scores by saving/loading from a local file.
- [ ] **Enemy Difficulty**: Increase alien speed as the number of enemies decreases.
- [ ] **Mobile/Web Port**: Explore Zig's ability to compile to WebAssembly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> Prerequisites

- [zig](https://ziglang.org/): version 0.15.2.

> Usage

Clone the repository and run the following command:

```console
zig build run
```
